# Phoenix Devcontainer Example

This is just a simplified example of how to configure a [VSCode Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for use with Elixir and Phoenix. It's not very comprehensive (see "Limitations" below), but it might serve as a decent place to start your own configuration.

:wave: Pull requests making this configuration more comprehensive and flexible are very welcome!

## Running the Example Application

For the most part this is a stock, base Phoenix application. The only additions to the application are:
- The `script/bootstrap` and `script/start` scripts, useful for getting the app running once you're in the container.
- The `config/dev.exs` configuration pointing Ecto at the PostgreSQL instance (using the `db` hostname available courtesy
  of the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` configuration).

Using the VSCode, when editing your working copy of this repository, use the Command Palette to run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

Install the Elixir and JS dependencies:

```shell
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

Start the server:

```shell
$ ./script/start
```

(Both of these scripts are very simple and are included merely as a convenience. You may prefer to run the commands they contain yourself.)

You will likely be prompted that the server is available by VSCodeâ€”you should be able to connect to it at http://localhost:4001.

## Reusing It

Copy the `.devcontainer` directory to your own project. You'll likely want to modify it somewhat (see "Limitations," below).

## Limitations

- The PostgreSQL server started does _not_ have a volume mounted for persistence. You'll want to modify the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file accordingly (using [`volumes`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes) to mount a directory at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, most likely).
- The `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` currently uses the latest official image (`elixir:latest`) and installs v15.x of NodeJS (for asset installation). This could be modified to be more flexible.
- The configuration doesn't currently install any useful VSCode extensions for you (such as ElixirLS).

## Contributing

Pull requests very welcome. Please take care to make any changes general purpose and not tied
to your specific application's configuration or version preferences.
